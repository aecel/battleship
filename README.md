## Known bugs

1. ONLY when Player 1 is a player and Player 2 is an AI:

At the second turn, the AI's turn, it takes two turns.
During these two turns, if in one of the turns, the AI hits a ship, it doesn't play the plunging animation.

2. ONLY when both players are AI, and only happens sometimes:

After someone wins, they keep going, so you have two winning boards at the end.

## Pizzazz that can be added

1. Better AI

2. Separate Randomize and Start buttons, but I kinda like it how it is right now idk

3. Sounds? With an option to mute

4. More animations?

5. Better placing ships UI for mobile (Drag and drop or something like that)
